                I'm currently working as a Client Analyst for Bswift, a cutting edge benefits administration company
                that creates user
                friendly enrollment portals for employees and facilitates transfering their information to vendors. In
                this
                role, I support my teams with system configuration, vendor management and data analysis. I also consult
                with clients on system functions, data flows and administrator training.
